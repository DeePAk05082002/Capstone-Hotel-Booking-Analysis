## üîç Sample EDA Questions

1. **Understand the distribution of meal plans (e.g., BB, HB, FB, SC) and identify any patterns or preferences.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dd0c3a2-f506-4e53-8911-7e09342be8d9)

- Query-Explanation:
This query analyzes the distribution of meal preferences across all bookings. Here's what each part does:

     * Selects the meal type from the meal_and_stay_details table
     *	Counts the total number of bookings for each meal type
     *	Calculates the percentage share of each meal type
     *	Uses a subquery (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meal_and_stay_details) to get the total bookings count
     *	Multiplies by 100 and rounds to 2 decimal places for readability
     *	Specifies the source table (meal_and_stay_details)
     *	Groups results by meal type to aggregate the counts
     *	Sorts results by total bookings in descending order (most popular meals first)

- Purpose:
     This query helps understand:
     *	The popularity distribution of different meal options
     *	Which meal types are most/least preferred by guests
     *	The relative market share of each meal category

- Query Result   :

2. **Understand the distribution of bookings across different market segments and calculate summary statistics for lead times within each segment.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab47cba1-aa44-4d4d-afd6-91beda3141a6)

 
- Query Explanation:

This SQL query analyzes booking distribution across different market segments. Here's what each part does:

1.	Columns Selected:
-	`b.market_segment_id` (aliased as Market_Segment_ID): The unique identifier for each market segment
-	`m.market_segment` (aliased as Market_Segment_Name): The descriptive name of each market segment
-	`count(b.Booking_id)` (aliased as Bookings): Counts the number of bookings per segment

2.	Tables Used:
-	`booking_source_and_history` (aliased as b): Contains booking records with segment IDs
-	`market_segment` (aliased as m): Contains segment ID-name mappings

3.	 Join Operation:
-	Inner join on `market_segment_id` connects booking records with segment names

4.	 Grouping:
-	Results are grouped by both segment ID and name to ensure accurate counting

- Purpose:
This query provides a clear view of booking volume distribution across different market segments, enabling analysis of which customer segments generate the most business. The results show both the technical ID and human-readable name for each segment along with their respective booking counts.

3.  **Analyze the impact of booking changes on cancellation rates. Calculate cancellation rates for bookings with different numbers of changes.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3970bc1-abf8-407b-8f64-ceafbea9c7d2)

 
- Query Explanation:
      This query analyzes the relationship between booking modifications and cancellation rates. Here's the breakdown:

  1.	Columns Selected:
  
         * rd.booking_changes: Number of modifications made to each booking
         * COUNT(b.booking_id): Total number of bookings for each modification count
         * SUM(CASE WHEN...Canceled...): Count of canceled bookings per modification count
         * Cancellation rate calculation: Percentage of bookings canceled per modification count
  2.	Tables Joined:
        
          * booking_details (core booking information)
          * room_details (contains booking_changes data)
          * reservation_status (contains cancellation status)
      
    3.	Key Corrections:
  
          * Changed SUN to SUM (function name correction)
          * Fixed the cancellation rate calculation to use canceled status
          * Standardized JOIN syntax

- Purpose:
   This query helps understand:
   ‚Ä¢	How frequently bookings are modified
   ‚Ä¢	Whether modification frequency correlates with cancellation likelihood
   ‚Ä¢	The cancellation risk associated with different numbers of booking changes
   The results can help identify if multiple booking changes serve as an early warning indicator for potential cancellations.
